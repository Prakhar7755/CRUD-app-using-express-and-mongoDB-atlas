HTTP status codes are standardized responses that servers send to clients indicating the success or failure of a request. Here are some of the most important HTTP status codes categorized by their general meaning:

### 1xx Informational responses

These are provisional responses indicating that the server has received the request and is continuing to process it.

- **100 Continue**: The server has received the initial part of the request and the client can continue with the rest of the request or ignore it if already completed.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is acknowledging the client's request to switch protocols (e.g., HTTP to HTTPS).

### 2xx Success

These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- **200 OK**: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created as a result.
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
- **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

### 3xx Redirection

These status codes indicate that further action needs to be taken by the client to fulfill the request.

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (Temporary Redirect)**: The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the `If-Modified-Since` or `If-None-Match` headers.

### 4xx Client Error

These status codes indicate that there was a problem with the client's request.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires authentication. The client needs to authenticate itself to get the requested response.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

### 5xx Server Error

These status codes indicate that there was an error on the server side while processing the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while trying to fulfill the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance of the server.

These are some of the most common and important HTTP status codes. Each status code provides a specific meaning which helps in understanding and debugging issues related to HTTP requests and responses.
